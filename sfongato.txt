1.1kg zuccini or zuccini-squash
400g feta
3-4 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup parmezan
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil

Step 1 - separate water from grated zuccini. Boil grated zuccini while
you keep removing water with a tablespoon into another pot, where you
reduce (boil) that excess water until it becomes a green paste which
is later added back to the grated zuccini. Keep doing this until the
grated zuccini has very little water left. As soon as it no longer
sheds much water as it is heated, remove from heat and let it
cool. Add the reduced zuccini paste that you have been preparing on
the side. Let cool.

Step 2 - mix all ingredients together

Step 3 - Bake at 375 for 10 minutes, lower to 350, bake for another 30
         minutes or until golder brown
