6-7 small zuccinis
0.5kg feta
3-4 eggs
1/4-1/2 cup yellow cheese 
1/4-1/2 cup sharp yellow cheese 

Boil them very slowly first in their own water to get rid of some
water. Do not throw away any water. There should be hardly any
left anyway.

Let cool.

Mix all together.

Bake at 425 for 30 minutes or till golden brown.
